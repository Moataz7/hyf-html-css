1.  Research how to create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command? 

Files starting with a dot are by default hidden. You can create it simply by

touch .Testfile.txt

Anyone will still be able to see it using

ls -a 


2. Research how to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command.

mkdir parent\child1\child2\child3\child4


3. Verify number of characters in the file.

31 fun

31 Bytes


4. I try alot of things but not working for example:

echo "test" > fun
echo -e "another test" >> fun

echo "test" > fun
echo -en "another test" >> fun

maybe we can use print command.
